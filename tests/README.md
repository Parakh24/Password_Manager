# Testing the password Generator

**In order to test the password generator logic, verify that:**

1. The password length is correct and respects the constraints.

2. It includes uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

3. It raises appropriate errors for invalid inputs.

4. The final password is randomized (no fixed pattern).  

**Edge Case Testing:**

1. Minimum allowed length
2. Maximum allowed length
3. Invalid Values(negative numbers, zero, non-integer input)

**Manual Testing:**

1. Does it give a mixed character type?
2. Is the length right?
3. Is it random when run multiple times?
